# FlightSim Utilities

A collection of small PowerShell utilities for flight simulation workflows.
Each tool lives in its own folder under `tools/` with its own README and changelog.

## Tools

- [Window Layout](tools/WindowLayout/) - generic capture/apply of window layouts for desktop apps
- [ToLiss Window Layout](tools/ToLiss-WindowLayout/) - ToLiss-focused layout + black border overlays

## Getting Started
- Navigate to the tool folder you want, read its README, and run the script(s) from there.
- Requires Windows for Win32 API calls and PowerShell 5.1+ or PowerShell 7+.

## Conventions
- Per-tool READMEs and CHANGELOGs live alongside code in each tool folder.
- Keep changes focused and minimal; prefer ASCII in docs and code comments.
